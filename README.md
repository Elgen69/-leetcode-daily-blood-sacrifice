# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Blood Sacrifice 🗡️

**The sacred grounds of daily algorithmic warfare, sanity loss, and green-square devotion.**

---

## 🧭 What Is This?

This repository is my public documentation of an unhinged, caffeine-fueled quest to solve **every single LeetCode problem** (all ~3600 of them) and become an **algorithmic weapon of mass destruction**.

Every day, I:
- Solve one (or more) LeetCode problem(s),
- Write clean and well-documented code,
- Rotate languages occasionally (Python, JavaScript, Java, maybe Rust if I snap),
- Keep track of the **core patterns** used (hashmaps, sliding window, dynamic programming, recursion, etc),
- And manually commit it all like a developer who *understands Git more than life*.

> This isn't just practice — it's a ritual.

---

## ✨ Why?

Because:

- I want to *truly understand* data structures and algorithms.
- I’m done pretending like I know Python/JavaScript/Java — now I will.
- I want a green GitHub graph that makes recruiters squint.
- And most of all… because I **can**.

## 🛠️ Languages Covered

I will be cycling through languages throughout this repo. These include:

- 🐍 Python (starting language)
- 🌐 JavaScript (later)
- ☕ Java (eventually)
- 🦀 Rust or C++ (when I ascend)

Each solution will be organized by:
1. Problem Number
2. Language
3. Date
4. Pattern / Technique used

## 📊 Progress Tracker

| Day | Date       | Problem                      | Difficulty | Language | Technique          |
|-----|------------|------------------------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1   | 2025-06-29 | Two Sum (#1)                 | Easy       | Python   | Hashmap / Dict      |
| 2   | TBD        | Best Time to Buy & Sell (#121) | Easy       | Python   | Greedy / 1-pass     |
| ... | ...        | ...                          | ...        | ...      | ...                 |

I will also track:
- Repeated patterns
- My speed improvements
- Personal notes or breakdowns

## 🧪 Philosophy

> “I want to get good enough at problem solving that I can walk into any codebase, any interview, any whiteboard, and just **cook**.”

---

## 🪓 Rules of the Grind

- 📅 Solve *at least one* problem daily.
- ✍🏽 No copying — only learning.
- 🧼 Keep code clean, readable, and minimal.
- 🧠 Focus on learning patterns — not memorizing answers.
- 🧘🏽 Stay calm, even when dynamic programming shows up.

---

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Build a visualization dashboard (maybe with React + D3) to track solved problems, techniques used, and language distribution.
- Create LeetCode-style clone problems to test myself.
- Eventually contribute to open-source algorithm libraries.
- Make memes about LeetCode pain.
