# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Blood Sacrifice 🗡️

**The sacred grounds of daily algorithmic warfare, sanity loss, and green-square devotion.**

---

## 🧭 What Is This?

This repository is my public documentation of an unhinged, caffeine-fueled quest to solve **every single LeetCode problem** (yes, all ~3600 of them — eventually) and become an **algorithmic weapon of mass destruction**.

Every day, I:
- Solve LeetCode problems,
- Rotate between real-world languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc),
- Keep notes and patterns per file,
- Push manually like an artisan coder who doesn’t trust auto-commit bots.

> This is not a tutorial repo. This is a training ground.

---

## ✨ Why?

Because:

- I want to *actually understand* the underlying patterns in data structures and algorithms.
- I’m tired of pretending I know a language — I’m going to *use* it until I do.
- I want my GitHub to look like a cyberpunk timesheet of pain and glory.
- And because I made a promise to my future self: no more tutorial hell, only algorithmic war.

## 🛠️ Languages I’m Grinding With

- 🐍 Python (starting language)
- 🌐 JavaScript (for async pain)
- ☕ Java (for OOP pain)
- 🦀 Maybe Rust (for ego pain)

Solutions are organized by problem title and language folder — no fancy file names, just war logs.

## 🧪 My Grind Rules

- 📅 One or more problems daily (unless I’m dead or dying).
- 🚫 No skipping “hard” problems forever — eventually they get done.
- 🧼 Code must be clean, readable, and minimal. If it looks like a leak, it’s rewritten.
- 🧠 Learning > speed.
- 📖 Writeups, patterns, or comments as needed per problem.
- 🪞 Reflect when confused. Rage push when enlightened.

---

## 🔮 Future Dumb Ideas

- A script that randomly assigns me a LeetCode problem daily like a loot box.
- A GitHub Action that yells at me when I don’t commit code for a day.
- A site that visualizes my LeetCode patterns like a neural network chart.
- A bot that tweets every time I pass a test case with the caption: *“He lives again.”*

## 🪓 Philosophy

> – Someone who has cried over backtracking

This repo is my sweat-stained, syntax-error-ridden portfolio of **actual algorithmic growth**. Not for flex. Not for clout. Just for **getting good**.
